# Easy Pie Chart Package

The **Easy Pie Chart** package provides a versatile pie chart widget for Flutter applications. It offers various customization options to create interactive and visually appealing pie charts.

## Features

- Three Pie Chart Variants:

  - Crust: Only border, no fill.
  - TriCrust: Borders around each pie slice.
  - Fill: Filled pie slices.

- Interactive Pie Slices:

  - Each pie slice is interactive and responds to user taps.

- Customization Options:
  - Adjustable gap between pie slices.
  - Control over the border edge style (rounded, squared, etc.).
  - Start angle of the pie chart can be customized.
  - Text or widget display options inside the pie chart.
  - Animations: Clockwise and anti-clockwise animations with adjustable duration.
